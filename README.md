# My Python Practice

This is just a place for me to dump all the things I'm practicing on with Python. I've found that I will often need to refresh my memory on something and I don't have everything I've covered on it saved (or I have deleted it). So I've just decided I'll have a single store of all my little toy projects that I've used to practice things on which I can refer to later if I need to. I'm hopeful that UV can work it's magic to keep all the dependecies manageable lol.
